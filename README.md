# Intel-based-professional-translation

## Introduction

This solution aims to provide a robust approach for bidirectional English-Chinese translation in specialized domains, leveraging large language models and specialized dictionaries.

Key technologies include using large language models for text translation and optimizing the translation of specialized terms with proprietary dictionaries (e.g., International Engineering Management Glossary).

This approach not only enhances translation accuracy but also ensures consistency and correctness of professional terminology.

With Intel's optimizations for large language models, efficiency and cost-effectiveness are improved, enabling efficient, low-cost translation of domain-specific texts. This solution is particularly suitable for fields such as engineering management, law, medicine, requiring highly specialized translations, significantly enhancing translation quality and operational efficiency.
